                        When an object is in contact with a rough surface, which is a surface with Friction
                        coefficients, the object experiences friction forces, these forces are always acting
                        in the opposite direction of any applied forces:

                        Every rough surface has a coefficient of friction, this coefficient determines the effect
                        of the friction force on the object, and there are two types of friction coefficients:

                        that can keep the object static (not in motion) if there exists applied forces on the object,
                        if the applied forces are greater than the static friction forces, the object is no longer static and will start to move.
