This Website was made with the intention of assisting High School Students and Teachers in expanding their knowledge and understanding of physics.
The Website inlcudes 7 Interactive Simulators; each simulator helps with visualizing real-life problems and calculating important quantities.
The 7 Simulators:
- Resultant Force (Net Force) Calculator
- Two-Dimensional Projectile Motion
- Friction Forces and Inclined Planes
- Elastic and Inelastic Collisions (Conservation of Momentum & Kinetic Energy)
- Uniform Circular Motion (Centripial Forces)
- Fluid Pressure & U-Tubes
- Bernoulli's Principle in Fluid Dynamics

In Each of the Simulators, you can find a light-blue button with the letter "i" on it. This button stores some notes and summarizations for the corresponding simulators.

NOTE: The Interactive Simulators are built using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas API.
Please check your browser's compatibility before running the simulations to avoid any errors.

WARNING: The Interactive Simulators might not be fully functional on mobile phone devices or any devices with a screen width less than 768px.
Using a tablet, laptop, or PC is recommended to avoid trouble with the UI and the simulations.

### TO ACCESS A SIMULATION:
### 1- Click on the Desired Simulator: For this Example I'm going to select the Fluid Pressure Simulator:
