**Welcome to the Physics Education Hub 1.0**

This Website was made with the intention of assisting High School Students and Teachers in expanding their knowledge and understanding of physics.
The Website inlcudes 7 Interactive Simulators; each simulator helps with visualizing real-life problems and calculating important quantities.
The 7 Simulators:
- Resultant Force (Net Force) Calculator
- Two-Dimensional Projectile Motion
- Friction Forces and Inclined Planes
- Elastic and Inelastic Collisions (Conservation of Momentum & Kinetic Energy)
- Uniform Circular Motion (Centripial Forces)
- Fluid Pressure & U-Tubes
- Bernoulli's Principle in Fluid Dynamics

In Each of the Simulators, you can find a light-blue button with the letter "i" on it. This button stores some notes and summarizations for the corresponding simulators.

NOTE: The Interactive Simulators are built using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas API.
Please check your browser's compatibility before running the simulations to avoid any errors.

WARNING: The Interactive Simulators might not be fully functional on mobile phone devices or any devices with a screen width less than 768px.
Using a tablet, laptop, or PC is recommended to avoid trouble with the UI and the simulations.

Additionally, the website offers a number of resources and books that can assist students in deeply comprehending Physics concepts.
All the sources and books the website offers are free and can be downloaded for personal use.  

Special Thanks to the people that helped with testing the website and the simulators,
giving feedback and recommendations that can be used for further development and improvement to the website:
