                        When an object is moving in a straight line, its velocity is the linear distance it 
                        covers in a certain amount of time. However, when an object is moving around a circular path,
                        it behaves differently than objects moving in a straight line.
                    </div>
                    <div class="lay-section">
                        For an object to be in uniform circular motion, it needs to have a constant force that 
                        always acts towards the center of the circular path, and a constant linear velocity that is
                        always tangent to the circular path.
                    </div>
                    <div class="lay-section">
                        The Angular Velocity (omega) of an object in uniform circular motion is calculated in different ways:
                        <br><br>
                        Given the radius of the circular path (r) and the linear velocity of the object (v):
                        <div class="lay-bold">
                            Angular Velocity (omega) = linear velocity (v) ÷ radius (r)
                        </div>
                        Given the angle covered by the object (theta) and the time it takes for the object to cover that angle (t):
                        <div class="lay-bold">
                            Angular Velocity (omega) = angle (theta) ÷ time (t)
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="lay-section">
                        The Centripetal Force is the force that always acts towards the center of the circular path, given the mass of
                        an object moving in a circular path (m), its linear velocity (v) an the radius of the circular path (r):
                        <div class="lay-bold">
                            Centripetal Force = m × v ^ 2 ÷ r
                        </div> 
                    </div>
                    <div class="lay-section">
                        For any object moving along a circular path with angular velocity (omega), the object completes one full rotation across
                        the entire path in a certain amount of time (t), which is called the Period Time (T):
                        <br><br>
                        Time Period (T): The time it takes for an object moving along a circular path to complete one full rotation across the entire path (or 360 degrees), 
                        can be calculated using the following formula:
                        <div class="lay-bold">
                            Time Period (T) = 2 × pi ÷ omega
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="lay-section">
                        The Frequency (f): is the amount of rotations an object can complete around a circular path in only one second:
                        <div class="lay-bold">
                            Frequency (f) = 1 ÷ Time Period (T)
